# Pure CSS Connect 4

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/farhanibne/pen/OJvwByj](https://codepen.io/farhanibne/pen/OJvwByj).

This is a CSS only connect four game, which can be played by two players (human vs human).
The red player takes the first turn. The goal is to form a row, column, or diagonal line of four discs in the same color. The game ends by either player winning, or as a draw.
It consists of 140 HTML elements and 350 lines of CSS. There are a lot of hacks in it to make the game playable. I couldn't have done this without the use of the :indeterminate pseudo-class and CSS counters.
The game should work on Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
